    "description":"<p>This project starts from an idea to transform in a real case, a Javascript algorithm, developed while i was attending a course. The main task of the original ðŸ‘‰<a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register\" target=\"_blank\"> Project</a>, needed to achieve a Certification from FreeCodeCamp, was <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:19px;\">to Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument. Cid is a 2D array listing available currency.</span></p><p>So, using Boostrap5, i decided to extend this algorithm to simulate a Cash calculator. Basically This Javascript User Interface, given a Price Amount and Paid Amount, based on what is present in the Cash-Drawer can:</p> <p>-Calculate what change give back, divided in each unit</p><p>-Update the Cash-Drawer</p><p>-Keep Track of all the Transactions</p><p>-Inform the user either there are some errors or the cash is impossible to cover.</p><p>It also, working with JSON and localStorage, keeping track of all the Transaction done, summed up in a Report page, where the user can download a JSON file containing all the transactions.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Below some excerpts from the Cash_Register.js the file behind the calculator.</span</p><p>Beyond the algorithm that calculate the cash to give back, there is an object constructor</p><img src=\"./works_img/txConstructor.png\" className=\"post_image\"><p>Every time a (valid) transaction happens, an object, summarizing datas like the price, the amount paid, the cash to give back and the new drawer is created and put in an array of transactions. This array is then stored locally, using lolcalStorage function (See below image), to be used in the Report page.</p><img src=\"./works_img/txConstructor_localStorage.png\" className=\"post_image\"><p>In the report page, the list is retrieved from the localStorage to compose the list of the Transactions and it is possible to download it in a JSON file, using FileSaver.js. </p><img src=\"./works_img/txConstructor_localStorage.png\" className=\"post_image\"><img src=\"./works_img/txConstructor_localStorage.png\" className=\"post_image\"><p>All the files, are available on my <a href=\"https://github.com/Andrea-vicari/Cash_register\">GitHub</a> page</span> and here the <a href=\"http://anvicdev.byethost7.com/cashreg/\">link</a> of the live demo with an istruction page.</p><p>ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I'm currently working on a version of this project using MYSql and NODE.js to store locally in the Database both Transactions and Drawer</span></p>",
