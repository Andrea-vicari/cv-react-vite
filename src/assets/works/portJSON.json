The template used was Andia and it is still working smooth, after almost 10 years. The website was developed in two languages, without using a plugin but simply inserting the different languages in two different directories. It was a low-budget project, with a custom made theme, but it is ligth-weight and still functional and responsive after many years"

The task was to find a clear and high-tech design, i took particularly care of the About section, showing all the several product they sell. Since they are electronic-component reseller, after a year, they decided to add a private e-commerce area, using Woocommerce in order to sell only to selected Customers.
